# Simple Unity Game

This repository contains a very small example of a Unity project. It shows how to create a simple 2D game where you can move a player using the arrow keys or `WASD`.

## Getting Started

1. Open Unity Hub and create a new 2D project.
2. Copy the `Assets` folder from this repository into the new project's directory.
3. Create a new scene and add a `Sprite` with a `Rigidbody2D` and `BoxCollider2D`.
4. Attach the `PlayerController` script to the Sprite.
5. Press play to move the character around.

The `PlayerController` script handles basic topâ€‘down movement.
